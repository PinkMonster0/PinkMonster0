											This game was designed and produced in 72 hours. We didn't consider how to make game at the beginning. We just thought that humans can't fight with bacteria directly. Our immune cells and the medicine we took helped us fight with bacteria. So, this is how we get the idea of this rare RTS mode.
										</p>

										<p>
											From two sides of the screen, immune cells and bacteria will be generated automatically and randomly. We intentionally adapted the generation rate, so bacteria will win if player don't do anything. And player can use different types of drugs to help immune cells to defeat bacteria.

											Contrary to the style of Inkun, we choose vivid and impactful colors in this game. We designed three levels corresponding three organs in human body. And we optimized the UI after the match.

											In this project, we have a clear division of works. I was in charge of developing visual effects(burst, brick broken, aggregation and some particle effects in the earliest demo).
