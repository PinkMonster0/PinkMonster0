											In 2016, I entered Shanghaitech University, majored in computer science. After the first year's basic computer science courses, I got interested in coding, especially in the project with beautiful visual effect. In spare time, I also learned the skills of using game engines by myself.
											After that, I made sure my aspiration in Computer Graphic and Game Developing. In one hand, I actively participated in the game technical lectures and gamejams. In the other hand, I took several electives in Computer Graphic and Computer Vision.
											they helped me to find my interest in rendering technique. they are the brige for me to associated computer science and  game engine technique. I'm very glad to take these courses.
										</p>

										<p>
											Art is another interest of me. Fortunately, ShanghaiTech found School of Creativity and Art(SCA) in 2017. I became the first group of students who can took courses of SCA. During the whole college time, I had taken Western Art History, Entertainment Design,
											User Experience Design and many other courses. And I became the teaching assistant of Experimental Animation course in Spring 2018.
										</p>

										<p>
 											Beyond the courses, I tried to find opportunities to work in game industry.In the summer of 2018, I got my first practice opportunity in Shanghai Hyron Software.
											I worked as level designer internship in a game studio of Hyron for two months, produced a project named 'Little Fist Combat'.Regrettably, this game didn't on sale at last according to the strict game license policy.
											In the working experience, I knew the operating mode of small game studio (in China).

											Because of winning the First Prize of NetEase College Mini Game Competetion, I got a technical artist internship offer in 2019 summer. NetEase is the second biggest game company in China. At here, I firstly came into contact with the job of technical art.
											Although as an internship, I tended to be asked to use commercial game engines to achieve the effect of visual designer in project's demo pre-research, I found that there would be more subdivision posts in bigger game project.
											For better supporting the game developing, I need to learn more professional knowledge.
										</p>

										<p>
											After I graduated from ShanghaiTech in July 2020, I become a technique artist of User Research Department in NetEase Shanghai now. In the actual work of TA, I begin to use the self-produced game engine of NetEase. After several tasks of online production,
											although some productions are famous in this industry, I find many limitations and irrational works in current game producing pipeline. So, I aspire to make games in a more flexible way. It requires me to get more knowledge about new techniques.
