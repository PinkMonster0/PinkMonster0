											With the given theme 'Kun', my teammates and I decide to make a Chinese traditional style game.
										</p>

										<p>
											We choose the ink painting as the art style, and use a third-party fluid plugin in Unity to create the ink effect. We render a horizontal continuous wrapped texture for the background and bind ink tails to the player and enemies.
										</p>

											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_05.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_03.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_02.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											Because 'Kun' is from 'Shan hai jing' (a Chinese traditional myth), we fabricate a story to associate 'Kun' with other fairy tales:
										</p>

										<p>
											Kun was an monster in the past. It was punished by the god because of its evil and divided to several parts. The player will manipulate one part of them, a drop of ink to defeat other evil and powerful parts (transform to villain in other fairy tale) to expiate
											and gather the power of 'Kun'.
										</p>

										</video>

										<p>
											We use the simple color composition, it looks nice and also simplify the user guidence (red means dangerous). The characters and bosses is designed with referring the Dunhuang mural style.
										</p>

											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											It's the first time for us to make a complete game. We pay much attention to story and art design, but the developing method is not so good. Anyway, it's a nice practice for me.
										</p>

										<p>
											We took two nearly two months to develop this game. There were many problems we found and fixed together. My mainly contributions in this project include designing background stories and programing in the interactive part logic(like player-control, ink pillows, flower field).
