											With the given theme 'Kun', my teammates and I decide to make a Chinese traditional style game.
										</p>

										<p>
											We choose ink painting as the art style of our game, and use a third-party fluid plugin in Unity to create the ink effect. We render a horizontal continuous texture as the background and bind ink tails to player and enemies.
										</p>

												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_03.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_02.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											Because 'Kun' is a character in 'Shan hai jing' (a Chinese traditional myth), we create a series of stories to associate 'Kun' with other fairy tales:
										</p>

										<p>
											Kun was a fierce monster in the past. It was punished by the god and its body was broken into several parts. The player manipulates the only good part of Kun, represented as a drop of ink,  to fight the other parts, which are evil and are transformed into villains in other fairy tales, towards the final reparation and rebirth.
										</p>

										</video>

										<p>
											We use a simple color scheme of red and black. It is visually appealing and informative, for example, red signaling danger. Our artistic design of the game characters and bosses followed the Dunhuang mural style.

											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											It's the first time for us to make a complete game. We took nearly two months to develop this game. It was a great learning process for us. My main contributions in this project include designing background stories and programing in the interactive logic(player-control, ink pillars, flower fields, etc).
