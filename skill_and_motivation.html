										<p>
											Since entering university, I have gradually learned skills in three directions.
											In computer science, I have mastered basic data structure and algorithm knowledge, and can use python, C++, matlab for program development.
											Although I have not conducted scientific research in the laboratory, in the field of computer vision and computer graphics, I have knowledge of some classic algorithm, and can learn and understand new papers in these directions.
											In terms of art, I can use mainstream art resource production tools to make game resources, including but not limited to Maya, 3dmax, Blender, Substaince Designer, Houdini, etc. Due to the current work, I am experienced in writing materials and shaders, and I can use Shader languages such as GLSL and HLSL to achieve designed effects.
											In terms of game development, I can use commercial game engines such as Unity and Unreal proficiently. Because of the requirement of company's self-developed engine, I also get some knowledge of DirectX architecture.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the future, I still want to work in the game industry. Although technical art is a job I like very much, there is still a huge technology gap between us and foreign countries. A lot of work, such as game engine development, is in the blank and copy stage. If a pipeline has been successfully verified in one project, it will be directly copied to another project. Sometime, it limits the game to be more interesting.
											I think the good production process should serve good ideas and design. In the future, I want to customize the game engine for games that I like. Therefore, I think I should learn more.
