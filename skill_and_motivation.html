											Since studying in university, I have gradually learned skills in three aspects.
										</p>

										<p>
											In computer science, I have grasped basic data structure and algorithm, and have the ability to use python, C++, MATLAB to develop programs.
											Although I haven't conducted scientific research in laboratory, I have learned the basic knowledge of computer vision and computer graphics. And I have the experience of reproducing some classic papers in this field.
											In the aspect of art, I can use mainstream designing tools, including but not limited to Maya, 3dmax, Blender, Substance Designer, Houdini. Due to the current work, I am experienced in making materials and shaders. I can use Shader languages such as GLSL and HLSL to achieve designed effects.
											In terms of game development, I can use several commercial game engines such as Unity and Unreal proficiently. Because of the requirement of using home-grown engine, I also get some knowledge about DirectX architecture.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the future, I still want to work in game industry. Although technical artist is a job I like very much, there is still a huge technology gap between Chinese game companies and world-famous game companies. A lot of works, such as game engine development, are in early stage. If a commercial mode or pipeline has been successfully verified in a project, it will be directly copied to another project. Sometimes, this strategy  hurts the quality of the game.
											I think the good production process should serve both good ideas and designs. In the future, I want to be an outstanding game engine developer and producer to customize the game engine and design production pipeline for high-quality and fun games.
