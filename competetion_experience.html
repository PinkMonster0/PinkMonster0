											During the college time, I participated in hackthons and gamejams with my friends actively. These experiences not only helped me learn a lot, but also let me confirmed what I was interested in.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2017, I teamed up with four friends to participated in Accenture Digital Global Connected Hackathon (<a href="https://www.accenture.cn/cn-zh/careers/event-digital-hackathon">https://www.accenture.cn/cn-zh/careers/event-digital-hackathon</a>).In this 24-hour Hackthon. Within 24 hours, participants need to make a series of concepts and prototypes of original digital products, and show social and economic values of them.
										</p>

										<p>
											We designed an travel app demo 'Passoul'. 'Passoul' is designed for youth group with sentimental emotion, and aims to create surprises for users on the journey.
											The application uses technologies such as location-based services, big data, and machine learning (in our tentative idea) to personalize the travel experience according to user's preferences.
											If the user is a movie enthusiast, the app will tell him that this was the important location of a classic movie; if the user likes history, the recommended message will be based on the history of the place.
										</p>

											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											Another feature of this app is that it can gather users with 'empathy'.
											When a user get information about a scenic spot by this application, he/she can see the messages of users who have the same preferences on the personalized page, and can interact with each other.
											The following is the concept video we made in the contest.(we didn't had copyright of the video resources, so this video was just used in this contest.)

										<p>
											In the end, we won the first prize by this app demo. For me, it's the first time to cooperate with teammates to develop product prototype and made presentation for it.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the summer of 2018, we found five students who liked game producing in Shanghaitech and formed team 'Photon' to participated in NetEase College Mini Game Competetion (<a href="https://game.academy.163.com/activity/miniGame/2018/review">https://game.academy.163.com/activity/miniGame/2018/review</a>).
										</p>

										<p>
											In preliminary match and semifinal, NetEase proposed the game theme 'Kun'(a fantasy monster in Shan hai jing) to participating teams. After investigation and discussion, we decided to use Chinese ink painting as the style of our game, and finally made the game "InKun".
										</p>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_06.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											With the attractive Chinese art style, we entered the final match. In the 72-hours final, centered on the theme "medicine", we boldly adopt a completely original game mode. we deconstructed the RTS game and reconstructed it in the perspective of bystander.After the intense development, we made the game 'Drug'(we used the name 'Body Cleaner' in the match)
											and won the first prize.

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Drug_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											After this match, the members of Photon founded a club named 'Rhynic Studio' in Shanghaitech. This association is now the earliest and most active game developing club in Shanghaitech.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2018, 'EverythingCrack' team gathered again and participated in 2018 Mushroom Brainstorm Contest. The competition is co-hosted by Schindler Elevator Asia Pacific R&D Center and entrepreneurial incubation platform InnoSpace.
											They hoped to capture innovative ideas from this competition, and rely on the technology and resources of Schindler's strong R&D team to turn outstanding ideas into industrial applications.
										</p>

										<p>
											At last, we got the idea from claustrophobia caring, design an interactive barrage game system named 'Elepainter'. Although the demo is very simple, our idea got the recognization of judges. And we won the First Prize of this match.

											For these four years, I want to sincerely thank my teammates.
