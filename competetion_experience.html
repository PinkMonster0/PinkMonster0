											During the college time, I participated in the hackthons and gamejams with my friends actively. These experiences not only helped me learn a lot, but also let me confirmed what I was interested in.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2017, I teamed up with my four friends to participated in Accenture Digital Global Connected Hackathon (<a href="https://www.accenture.cn/cn-zh/careers/event-digital-hackathon">https://www.accenture.cn/cn-zh/careers/event-digital-hackathon</a>).In this 24-hour Hackthon. Within 24 hours, participants need to make a series of concepts and prototypes of original digital products, and show social and economic values of them.
										</p>

										<p>
											We designed an travel app demo 'Passoul'. 'Passoul' is designed for youth group with sentimental emotion, and aims to create surprises for users on the journey.
											The application uses technologies such as location-based services, big data, and machine learning (in our tentative idea) to personalize the travel experience according to user's preferences.
											If the user is a movie enthusiast, the app will tell him that this was the important location of a classic movie; if the user likes history, the recommended message will be based on the history of the place.
										</p>

											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											Another feature of this app is that it can gather users with 'empathy'.
											When a user get information about a scenic spot by this application, he/she can see the messages of users who have the same preferences on the personalized page, and can interact with each other.
											The following is the concept video we made in the contest.(we didn't had copyright of the video resources, so this video was just used in this contest.)

										<p>
											In the end, we won the first prize by this app demo. For me, it's the first time to cooperate with teammates to develop product prototype and made presentation for it.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the summer of 2018, we found five students who liked game producing in Shanghaitech and formed team 'Photon' to participated in NetEase College Mini Game Competetion.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the two-month preliminary and semi-final matches, NetEase proposed to the participating teams the game theme 'Kun'(the fantasy monster in Shan hai jing). After investigation and discussion, we decided to use Chinese ink painting as the style of our game, and finally made the game "InKun".
										</p>

											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_06.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											With the attractive Chinese art style, we entered the final match. In the 72-hour final, centered on the game theme "medicine". we boldly adopt a completely original game mode, deconstruct the RTS game and reconstruct it with the perspective of bystander.After 72 hours of intense development, we made the game 'Drug'(we use 'Body Cleaner' in the match)
											and won the first prize.

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Drug_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											After this match, we, the members of Photon, found a societies named 'Rhynic Studio' in Shanghaitech. This societies is now the earliest and most active game developing club in Shanghaitech.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2018, 'EverythingCrack' team gathered again and participate in 2018 Mushroom Brainstorm Contest. The competition is co-hosted by Schindler Elevator Asia Pacific R&D Center and entrepreneurial incubation platform InnoSpace.
											They hoped to capture innovative ideas from this competition, and rely on the technology and resources of Schindler's strong R&D team to turn outstanding ideas into industrial applications.
										</p>

										<p>
											At last, we got the idea from claustrophobia caring, design an light interactive barrage game system named 'Elepainter'. Although the demo is not mature, our idea got the recognization of judges. And we won the First Prize of this match.

											For these four years, I want to sincerely thank my teammates for supporting me in my horrible time. We encourage and learn from each other along the way, it's an unforgettable journey.
