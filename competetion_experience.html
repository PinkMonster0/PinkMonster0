											During the college time, I actively participated in the contests like hackthons and gamejams with my friends. These experiences not only let me learn more skills, but also helped me realize my interest.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2017, I teamed up with my four friends (named as 'EverythingCrack') to participated in Accenture Digital Global Connected Hackathon.In this 24-hour Hackthon, participants need to make a series of concepts and prototypes of new products and services, and show certain social and economic values of them.
										</p>

										<p>
											We proposed and designed an travel app demo 'Passoul'. 'Passoul' is designed for youth group with sentimental emotion, and aims to create surprises for users during the journey.
											The application uses technologies such as geographic location-based services, big data, and machine learning (envisaged) to personalize the scenery during the trip according to the user's preferences.
											If the user is a movie enthusiast, the app will tell him that this was the location of a classic movie; if the user likes history, the recommended message will be based on the history of the place.
										</p>

												<div class="col-5-small"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Accenture_02.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											Another feature of this app is that it can gather users with 'empathy'.
											When a user learns about a certain scenic spot through the application, he/she can see the messages of users who have the same preferences as him/her on the personalized page, and can interact with each other.
											The following is the concept video we made in the contest.(we didn't had copyright of the vedio material, so this vedio just was used in this contest.)
										</p>

											<source src="videos/Accenture_vedio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>

										<p>
											In the end, we won the first prize by this app demo. For me, it's the first successful experience to cooperate with teammates to propose and refine ideas, produce demo and give a public presentation.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the summer of 2018, we found five students who liked game developing in Shanghaitech and formed a team 'Photon' to participated in NetEase College Mini Game Competetion.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the two-month preliminary and semi-final matches, NetEase proposed to the participating teams the game theme 'Kun'(the fantasy monster in Shan hai jing). After investigation and discussion, we decided to use Chinese ink painting as the style of our game, and finally made the game "InKun".
										</p>

										<div class="box alt">
											<div class="row gtr-uniform">
												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Inkun_06.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											With the attractive Chinese art style, we entered the final match. In the 72-hour final, centered on the game theme "medicine". we boldly adopt a completely original game mode, deconstruct the RTS game and reconstruct it with the perspective of bystander.After 72 hours of intense development, we made the game 'Drug'(we use 'Body Cleaner' in the match)
											and won the first prize.
										</p>

												<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Drug_04.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
										</div>

										<p>
											After this match, we, the members of Photon, found a societies named 'Rhynic Studio' in Shanghaitech. This societies is now the earliest and most active game developing club in Shanghaitech.
										</p>

										<p>
											In Nov. 2018, 'EverythingCrack' team gathered again and participate in 2018 Mushroom Brainstorm Contest. The competition is co-hosted by Schindler Elevator Asia Pacific R&D Center and entrepreneurial incubation platform InnoSpace.
											They hoped to capture innovative ideas from this competition, and rely on the technology and resources of Schindler's strong R&D team to turn outstanding ideas into industrial applications.
										</p>

										<p>
											At last, we got the idea from claustrophobia caring, design an light interactive barrage game system named 'Elepainter'. Although the demo is not mature, our idea got the recognization of judges. And we won the First Prize of this match.
